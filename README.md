#### Build Tools & Versions Used.
Android Studio 4.1.1
Target Version 30


#### Focus Areas.
I try to follow MVVM as suggested by Android. Even though view model does not transform any data it is good practice.
Also navigation Jetpack library is a good practice as we always have to assume future requirements in the app.
I did just few unit tests focusing on the respository as is the one who handles the error logic.


#### Copied-in code or copied-in dependencies.
  The copy code was the one used as example for these libreries.
  - Retrofit: https://square.github.io/retrofit/
  - Glide: https://github.com/bumptech/glide
  - Dagger 2: https://dagger.dev/
  - Navigation: https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation
